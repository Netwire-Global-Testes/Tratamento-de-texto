US: During the week of Sept. 12, I traveled to Argentina in support of our business interests
in this increasingly important supply region. 
BR:

US: At the Argentina Business and Investment Forum in Buenos Aires, I joined other CEOs in expressing strong support for the pro-business policies of President Mauricio Macri’s new government. 
BR: 

US: Argentina has tremendous potential to help feed the world with its vast corn and soybean production; this optimistic view was shared by the local farmers I met during this trip. 
BR: 

US: The challenge now is for the Macri government to continue making its tax policies competitive with those of competing origins. 
BR:

US: So in my public comments at the Forum, I emphasized this issue, as well as the need for the country to step up its investments in critical infrastructure. For efficiency’s sake, Argentina needs to move more of its grain via rail and barge, and less via truck. But this cannot be accomplished without a significant commitment from the government, in partnership with the private sector.
